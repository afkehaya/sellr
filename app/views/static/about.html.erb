                <h5> We love recurring revenue and we think that you do to!</h5>
                <h5>
                  We're allways looking for was to generate recurring revenue for
                  our business so that we can invest in entreprenurs and focus on

                <h5>
                  In our search for projects that could generate this kind of revenue we
                  came accross several companies who overed a recurring revenue based commission
                  for every sale. This sparked the idea for Midas Merchants, an api
                  that will enable anyone to offer recurring revenue as a commission on sales and a marketplace
                  where affiliats can find ways to generate recurring revenue for themselves.
